      "This was an early project to redesign the <a href='https://www.topmath.info'>www.topmath.info</a> website for a friend. The original was simple HTML only. Shawn limited it to just HTML and CSS to create a more dynamic and appealing site, but as it is a very static site, it did not need the more active JavaScript.",

    description:
      "Part of the administrative tasks for the Knights of Columbus is to keep track of what charitable contributions and programs have been completed in a calendar year. There is currently no simple way of this data to be collected. Shawn created this React app that collects the data, stores it in a NoSQL database, and then retrieves it with the compiled data for a yearly report. Future expansions and modifications will make sure each field is required and fits the format correctly, as well as collecting and storing data for multiple councils instead of just one currently.",
