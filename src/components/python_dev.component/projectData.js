Instead of counting with paper and pencil, I created this script that the user provides the number of each bill and then the script calculates the total. The user can also provide checks, and change as well. I have also since changed to to a javascript version that you can find under the WebDev section.",

    description:
      "I've always been a fan of the Magic 8 Ball. While learning python I coded a standard 8 ball that ran in the terminal, and decided I want more. So I made a version based on the character Gudetama from the Hello Kitty world. He is very blase which made it funnier. I also used PyQT to make it run and look like a regular computer program. I may come back and update it so it looks less like Windows 98 and more modern.",
